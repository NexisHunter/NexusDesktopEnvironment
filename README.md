### Nexus Desktop Environment

This project represents what will become the desktop environment of a custom linux operating system, Nexus OS (WIP). 


#### Versioning

__Note:__
Once the system, packaged as `nexus_os_system`, reaches a stable phase, v1 will be released. Until then versioning will be `v0.X.Y` where `X` will represent a major change in the `lib/ui` library API and `Y` will represent the minor changes. Upon release of `v1.0.0` the repo will revert to standard Dart [versioning](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning#semantic-versions).
